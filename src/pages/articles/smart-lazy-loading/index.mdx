One of the most powerful techniques to improve the perceived performance of a website is **lazy loading**. By loading non-critical content only when needed, you reduce initial load time, save bandwidth, and provide a faster experience to your users.

In this detailed article, weâ€™ll explore:

- What lazy loading is and how it works
- Native lazy loading for images
- Using `IntersectionObserver` for custom lazy strategies
- Dynamic imports and code splitting in React and Next.js
- Best practices to make your implementation effective and SEO-friendly

## ðŸ§  What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy loading refers to **delaying the loading of resources** (images, scripts, components) until they are about to enter the viewport. This allows the browser to load only what's necessary initially.

It improves performance metrics like:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)

The simplest and most widely supported method is to use:

```html
<img src="/images/hero.jpg" alt="Hero banner" loading="lazy" />
