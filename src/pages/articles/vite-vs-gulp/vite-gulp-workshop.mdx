## 🎯 Workshop Goals

- Understand the architectural differences between Gulp and Vite
- Set up a basic Vite project
- Migrate a simple Gulp-based pipeline to Vite
- Explore hybrid workflows

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ v18
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with npm or yarn

---

## 📁 Step 1: Set Up a Legacy Gulp Project

Create a basic Gulp project that compiles SCSS, minifies JS, and moves files to a `dist/` folder.

Provide:

- `gulpfile.js`
- `src/scss/`, `src/js/`, `src/index.html`

Run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass gulp-clean-css gulp-uglify
```

---

## ⚡ Step 2: Rebuild It in Vite

1. Create a new Vite project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest vite-project -- --template vanilla
cd vite-project && npm install
```

2. Move styles and scripts into `src/`

3. Configure `vite.config.js` for output folder, static files, and CSS

---

## 🔀 Step 3: Run Both in Parallel

Use this setup to observe differences in:

- Build times
- Live reloading
- Bundle sizes

---

## 🔍 Exercise

Try migrating:

- Custom font loading
- Image optimization plugin (e.g., `gulp-imagemin` vs `vite-imagetools`)
- HTML templating (e.g., Handlebars vs EJS with Vite plugin)

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Gulp is powerful for non-JS pipelines
- Vite excels at JavaScript module-based development
- Combining both can support legacy + modern workflows

---

## 💬 Optional Challenge

Add TailwindCSS to the Vite setup and reconfigure your SCSS to use utility classes.

---

## ✅ Summary

You’ve migrated a basic build pipeline from Gulp to Vite. You’ve explored differences in speed, simplicity, and DX — and how to adopt modern workflows with minimal friction.
